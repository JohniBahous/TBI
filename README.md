__PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS__

## __THE BRAGI INITIATIVE__
A production‑oriented full‑stack application engineered entirely from scratch to simulate real-world development conditions. Unlike typical portfolio or tutorial-based projects, TBI demonstrates system design, backend architecture, database modeling, and cloud storage integration at a professional level.

The project required creating a fully custom Webpack configuration, writing all API routes, structuring a complete backend, designing the database schema, and managing secure communication with AWS S3. Almost every part of the system—frontend logic, routing, API design, authentication, environment management, and deployment—was created by hand without boilerplate.

# Core Responsibilities & Engineering Contributions:

* Designed and built a complete system architecture: custom Webpack React SPA → Node.js/Express API → PostgreSQL → AWS S3 cloud storage.

* Developed a custom Webpack build pipeline with Babel, asset optimization, code splitting, production minification, and static asset delivery.

* Implemented fully modular React components and views, including protected layouts, form flows, and user-specific pages.

* Built the backend from scratch with Express: routing, controllers, validation, error handling, middleware layers, and clean API structure.

* Created the PostgreSQL schema, relational models, and efficient SQL queries for persistent user and file data.

* Integrated AWS S3 securely, including signed URL handling, file type validation, and bucket object lifecycle considerations.

* Implemented custom authentication and authorization logic (tokens, hashing, secure sessions).

* Managed multi-service deployment on Render: static frontend hosting, Node.js backend service, and managed PostgreSQL database.

* Maintained a clean, professional Git workflow with documented commits and feature-based branches.

# Key Features:

* Production-ready React SPA with a handcrafted Webpack configuration.

* Authentication flows with protected routes and secure token validation.

* File upload, storage, and retrieval through AWS S3 using secure signed URLs.

* Robust REST API with validation, middleware, and modular controllers.

* PostgreSQL-based persistent data layer with structured relational modeling.

* Responsive and scalable UI with attention to clean component design.

* End-to-end deployment pipeline using GitHub → Render.

## Tech Stack: React, Webpack, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, TypeScript, REST API
